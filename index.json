Recent research suggests that individual differences in utilitarian tendencies fall along two dimensions: a permissive attitude toward harming others for greater good (instrumental harm) and an impartial concern for others welfare (impartial beneficence). We hypothesize that these dimensions operate as intuitive theories in the moral domain framing distinctive patterns of moral judgments and behavior. Using intersubject representational similarity analysis of behavioral data (N = 254), we found that when participants shared endorsement of instrumental harm or impartial beneficence, they showed similar patterns of moral judgment and decision making. Intersubject representational similarity analysis of functional neuroimaging data (N = 68) revealed that participants with similar endorsement of instrumental harm or impartial beneficence showed similar neural encoding of moral choice attributes, even when they made different choices. Meanwhile participants with dissimilar endorsement of these dimensions showed distinctive neural encoding of moral choice attributes, even when they made similar choices. These similarity and dissimilarity patterns emerged in distinct brain regions for instrumental harm and impartial beneficence. Together, our findings suggest that instrumental harm and impartial beneficence distinctively frame cognitive representations of moral decision problems, over and above guiding judgments and decisions.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Moral Psychology","Decision Neuroscience","Computational Modeling"],"title":"Instrumental harm and impartial beneficence distinctively frame cognitive representations of moral decision problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Paul, L.","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704085200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704085200,"objectID":"c8df531b1bed8cb00366d02c176baf48","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2023-s/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2023-s/","section":"publication","summary":"Our paper contributes to the rapidly expanding body of experimental research on transformative decision making, and in the process, marks out a novel empirical interpretation for assessments of subjective value in transformative contexts. We start with a discussion of the role of subjective value in transformative decisions, and then critique extant experimental work that explores this role, with special attention to Reuter and Messerli (2018). We argue that current empirical treatments miss a crucial feature of practical deliberation manifesting across a variety of everyday decisions: often, people attach more weight to decision criteria that they can know - a phenomenon known as the evaluability bias. In transformative contexts, if people cannot know the subjective value of an option, they are unlikely to attach it much weight. Despite this, people may care very much about such value. We then use this point to develop and present new empirical results that, in addition to supporting our concerns about evaluability bias, support the hypothesis that people care about subjective value. Our work enriches the current philosophical understanding of transformative decisions and helps to frame the emerging experimental paradigm for the empirical dimensions of the debate.","tags":["Social Psychology","Epistemology","Decision"],"title":"How evaluability bias shapes transformative decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How do we make decisions regarding transformative experiences, given that these very experiences could potentially change our preferences?\nHow does our cognitive representation of the experiences of others, which are outside our own lived experiences, shape the social decisions we make?\n","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"b5cdd1eee39211816ceb1287aa6c401e","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/project/c-decision-making/","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/c-decision-making/","section":"project","summary":"\nHow do we make decisions regarding transformative experiences, given that these very experiences could potentially change our preferences?\nHow does our cognitive representation of the experiences of others, which are outside our own lived experiences, shape the social decisions we make?","tags":["Decision making"],"title":"Decision-making","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" What cognitive mechanisms underlie our (in)ability to acknowledge the limits of comprehending others\u0026rsquo; lived experiences?\nWhat are the interventions that can foster epistemic humility, and which cognitive processes could be targeted? \n","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"c8e325ea8aa40ee300e3cf3772d8709d","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/project/b-epistemic-humility/","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/b-epistemic-humility/","section":"project","summary":"\nWhat cognitive mechanisms underlie our (in)ability to acknowledge the limits of comprehending others' lived experiences?\nWhat are the interventions that can foster epistemic humility, and which cognitive processes could be targeted?","tags":["Epistemic Humility"],"title":"Epistemic Humility","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Whether and how do moral norms culturally evolve?\nHow do we adjudicate between different moral principles when they conflict?\nWhat are cognitive subcomponents of utilitarianism and deontology?\n","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"9bedbe4744c981978578e168f39b55bd","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/project/a-moral-norms/","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/a-moral-norms/","section":"project","summary":"\nWhether and how do moral norms culturally evolve?\nHow do we adjudicate between different moral principles when they conflict?\nWhat are cognitive subcomponents of utilitarianism and deontology?","tags":["Moral Norm"],"title":"Moral Norm \u0026 Ethics","type":"project"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Chang, S.W.C.","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629345600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629345600,"objectID":"6bd2c8dd57030d880768b563dd621e21","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-19T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans have an exceptional ability to cooperate relative to many other species. We review the neural mechanisms supporting human cooperation, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. One key feature of human social life is the prevalence of cooperative norms that guide social behavior and prescribe punishment for noncompliance. Taking a comparative approach, we consider shared and unique aspects of cooperative behaviors in humans relative to nonhuman primates, as well as divergences in brain structure that might support uniquely human aspects of cooperation. We highlight a medial prefrontal network common to nonhuman primates and humans supporting a foundational process in cooperative decision-making: valuing outcomes for oneself and others. This medial prefrontal network interacts with lateral prefrontal areas that are thought to represent cooperative norms and modulate value representations to guide behavior appropriate to the local social context. Finally, we propose that more recently evolved anterior regions of prefrontal cortex play a role in arbitrating between cooperative norms across social contexts, and suggest how future research might fruitfully examine the neural basis of norm arbitration.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Prosociality","Decision Neuroscience"],"title":"Prefronal cortex and (uniquely) human cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Everett, J.A.C.","Colombatto, C.","......","\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625112000,"objectID":"30e555a2d0b8885d6dc7863012dbce8a","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/everett-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Trust in leaders is central to citizen compliance with public policies. One potential determinant of trust is how leaders resolve conflicts between utilitarian and non-utilitarian ethical principles in moral dilemmas. Past research suggests that utilitarian responses to dilemmas can both erode and enhance trust in leaders: sacrificing some people to save many others (‘instrumental harm’) reduces trust, while maximizing the welfare of everyone equally (‘impartial beneficence’) may increase trust. In a multi-site experiment spanning 22 countries on six continents, participants (N = 23,929) completed self-report (N = 17,591) and behavioural (N = 12,638) measures of trust in leaders who endorsed utilitarian or non-utilitarian principles in dilemmas concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Across both the self-report and behavioural measures, endorsement of instrumental harm decreased trust, while endorsement of impartial beneficence increased trust. These results show how support for different ethical principles can impact trust in leaders, and inform effective public communication during times of global crisis.","tags":["Social Psychology","Moral Psychology"],"title":"Moral dilemmas and trust in leaders during a global health crisis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Kim, S.","Kim, H.","Crockett, M.J.","Ahn, WY."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622520000,"objectID":"75e468c785fa8bb61cc74f488c56fca3","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2021-r/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2021-r/","section":"publication","summary":"Research on the neurocomputational mechanisms of moral judgment has typically focused on contrasting utilitarian preferences to impartially maximize aggregate welfare and deontological preferences that judge the morality of actions based on rules. However, there has been little work to decompose the cognitive subcomponents of deontological preferences. Here, we investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying two types of deontological preferences (Rawlsian and Kantian) and their contrast with utilitarian preferences in an incentivized moral dilemma task.. Participants repeatedly decided how to allocate harm between a single individual (“the one”) and a group of 3-4 individuals (“the group”). The task distinguished preferences for Rawlsian, Kantian and utilitarian strategies by quantifying trade-offs among the active harm, concern for the worst-off individual, and overall utility. Behaviorally, participants favored the Rawlsian strategy, preferring to impose more harm overall rather than disproportionately harm the one individual. Computational modeling revealed two dissociable dimensions of individual variability in Rawlsian preferences: i) minimizing the maximum amount of harm delivered to a single person and ii) subjective threshold of acceptable amount of harm imposed on one person. Combination of Univariate and multivariate approaches to fMRI data revealed the engagement of distinct brain regions in those two dimensions of Rawlsian preferences, which respectively mapped onto activity in mentalizing and valuation networks. Our results reveal the neurocomputational mechanisms guiding tradeoffs between the welfare of one versus all, and highlight the distinct role of the mentalizing network and valuation network in shaping Rawlsian moral preferences.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Moral Psychology","Decision Neuroscience","Computational Modeling"],"title":"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Shin, Y.","Carlson, R.","Chang, S.","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591156800,"objectID":"775bede22c0eb15c616b3c130ecb3549","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2020-d/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2020-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Theories of distributive justice highlight different approaches for how people ought to allocate scarce resources. End-result principles advocate strict equality of outcomes while historical principles allow for some inequality depending on how it came about. However, it remains unclear which principles ordinary people follow when making resource distribution decisions. Here, we investigated to what extent online participants followed historical principles in distributive decision-making, focusing on the roles of productivity and luck in resource allocation. We developed a new paradigm in which participants allocated money between two workers whose incomes were unequal due to both their productivity (how much work they initially produced) and luck (financial losses beyond their control). Across five studies, a strong majority of participants followed historical principles in distributive justice decisions. However, participants also varied substantially in how they applied those principles. Sensitivity to luck and productivity were negatively correlated with one another, and prioritizing productivity over luck was correlated with conservative and neoliberal ideology. We identified two groups of participants: a 'meritocratic' group who rewarded productivity and ignored the role of luck when distributing resources, and a 'anti-meritocratic' group who compensated for bad luck and low productivity in distributive decisions. Making luck more salient in the decision process increased sensitivity to luck in distributive decision-making and eliminated the negative correlation between productivity and luck. Overall, our findings demonstrate that historical principles in distributive decision-making manifest differently across diverse political ideologies, but also can be altered by highlighting hidden factors contributing to inequality.","tags":["Social Psychology","Epistemology","Decision"],"title":"","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
