Recent work suggests that individual differences in utilitarian tendencies fall along two dimensions: a permissive attitude towards harming others for some greater good (instrumental harm) and an impartial concern for others’ welfare (impartial beneficence). Here, we investigated whether these two dimensions are dissociable in behavior and brain activity during moral decision-making. In studies of both incentivized and hypothetical decisions to earn money by inflicting pain on oneself or a stranger (N=79 and N=192), instrumental harm positively predicted harming others, while impartial beneficence negatively predicted harming others relative to oneself. Inter-subject representational similarity analysis of functional neuroimaging data (N = 68) revealed that participants with similar utilitarian tendencies showed similar neural encoding of moral choice attributes, even if they made different choices. These similarity patterns emerged in distinct brain regions for instrumental harm and impartial beneficence. Our results provide behavioral and neural support for a two-dimensional model of utilitarianism that dissociates instrumental harm from impartial beneficence and suggest that a commitment to particular moral principles predicts neural representations of moral choice attributes over and above the actual decisions people make.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Moral Psychology","Decision Neuroscience","Computational Modeling"],"title":"Behavioral and neural evidence for a two-dimensional model of utilitarianism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Kim, S.","Kim, H.","Crockett, M.J.","Ahn, WY."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685592000,"objectID":"c081282200d521e67938f16150b35a20","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2023-r/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2023-r/","section":"publication","summary":"Research on the neurocomputational mechanisms of moral judgment has typically focused on contrasting utilitarian preferences to impartially maximize aggregate welfare and deontological preferences that judge the morality of actions based on rules. However, there has been little work to decompose the cognitive subcomponents of deontological preferences. Here, we investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying two types of deontological preferences (Rawlsian and Kantian) and their contrast with utilitarian preferences in an incentivized moral dilemma task.. Participants repeatedly decided how to allocate harm between a single individual (“the one”) and a group of 3-4 individuals (“the group”). The task distinguished preferences for Rawlsian, Kantian and utilitarian strategies by quantifying trade-offs among the active harm, concern for the worst-off individual, and overall utility. Behaviorally, participants favored the Rawlsian strategy, preferring to impose more harm overall rather than disproportionately harm the one individual. Computational modeling revealed two dissociable dimensions of individual variability in Rawlsian preferences: i) minimizing the maximum amount of harm delivered to a single person and ii) subjective threshold of acceptable amount of harm imposed on one person. Combination of Univariate and multivariate approaches to fMRI data revealed the engagement of distinct brain regions in those two dimensions of Rawlsian preferences, which respectively mapped onto activity in mentalizing and valuation networks. Our results reveal the neurocomputational mechanisms guiding tradeoffs between the welfare of one versus all, and highlight the distinct role of the mentalizing network and valuation network in shaping Rawlsian moral preferences.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Moral Psychology","Decision Neuroscience","Computational Modeling"],"title":"Decomposing the neurocomputational mechanisms of deontological moral preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlson, R.W.","\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Morris, A.","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681790400,"objectID":"6231da9672a392ec5c3f1b97277776e8","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/carlson-2023/","publishdate":"2023-04-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/carlson-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"How well do people know their own motives? As veridical as introspection might seem intuitively, scientists often question subjective reports on motives, deeming them biased, inaccurate, or no more revealing than inferences made by outside observers. Such concerns about introspection are often cited, but less often tested. Here we present an approach for quantifying introspective accuracy and bias. Across five experiments (N=2191), we systematically compared people’s subjective reports of how much they wanted different outcomes to the preferences revealed by their actual choices. To probe biases, we compared a choice domain which typically features self-image concerns (reporting prosocial motivation) with one which does not (reporting nonsocial motives; Experiments 1a \u0026 1b). To test for an insider advantage in introspective accuracy, we compared the accuracy of people’s reports about their own motives to the reports of an independent set of “observer” participants (Experiment 2). Finally, to probe whether subjective reports capture dynamic changes in motives, we examined introspective accuracy before and after experimentally shifting people’s social preferences (Experiments 3a \u0026 3b). Across all experiments, we find evidence of robust introspective accuracy. Subjective reports of motives were strongly correlated with revealed preferences— exceeding chance and inferences made by observers—and these reports accurately updated when preferences changed. We also detected a bias: individuals whose motives deviated from their own standards tended to distort their level of prosocial motivation. By developing a method for probing the precision of motive introspection, this work challenges assumptions about its inherent unreliability—instead highlighting the value of subjective reports for predicting human behavior.","tags":["Social Psychology","Computational Modeling"],"title":"Quantifying accuracy and bias in motive introspection.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Chang, S.W.C.","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629345600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629345600,"objectID":"6bd2c8dd57030d880768b563dd621e21","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/zoh-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-19T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zoh-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans have an exceptional ability to cooperate relative to many other species. We review the neural mechanisms supporting human cooperation, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. One key feature of human social life is the prevalence of cooperative norms that guide social behavior and prescribe punishment for noncompliance. Taking a comparative approach, we consider shared and unique aspects of cooperative behaviors in humans relative to nonhuman primates, as well as divergences in brain structure that might support uniquely human aspects of cooperation. We highlight a medial prefrontal network common to nonhuman primates and humans supporting a foundational process in cooperative decision-making: valuing outcomes for oneself and others. This medial prefrontal network interacts with lateral prefrontal areas that are thought to represent cooperative norms and modulate value representations to guide behavior appropriate to the local social context. Finally, we propose that more recently evolved anterior regions of prefrontal cortex play a role in arbitrating between cooperative norms across social contexts, and suggest how future research might fruitfully examine the neural basis of norm arbitration.","tags":["fMRI","Social Neuroscience","Neuroeconomics","Prosociality","Decision Neuroscience"],"title":"Prefronal cortex and (uniquely) human cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Everett, J.A.C.","Colombatto, C.","......","\u003cb\u003eZoh, Y.\u003c/b\u003e","Crockett, M.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625112000,"objectID":"30e555a2d0b8885d6dc7863012dbce8a","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/publication/everett-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Trust in leaders is central to citizen compliance with public policies. One potential determinant of trust is how leaders resolve conflicts between utilitarian and non-utilitarian ethical principles in moral dilemmas. Past research suggests that utilitarian responses to dilemmas can both erode and enhance trust in leaders: sacrificing some people to save many others (‘instrumental harm’) reduces trust, while maximizing the welfare of everyone equally (‘impartial beneficence’) may increase trust. In a multi-site experiment spanning 22 countries on six continents, participants (N = 23,929) completed self-report (N = 17,591) and behavioural (N = 12,638) measures of trust in leaders who endorsed utilitarian or non-utilitarian principles in dilemmas concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Across both the self-report and behavioural measures, endorsement of instrumental harm decreased trust, while endorsement of impartial beneficence increased trust. These results show how support for different ethical principles can impact trust in leaders, and inform effective public communication during times of global crisis.","tags":["Social Psychology","Moral Psychology"],"title":"Moral dilemmas and trust in leaders during a global health crisis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoonseo Zoh"],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the pdf file of my slides.\n ","date":1591675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591675200,"objectID":"474eb37e1d0d7ca94f10ee36c10ab645","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/talk/park/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/park/","section":"talk","summary":"Neural computations underlying strategic social decision-making in groups","tags":["Computational Modeling","Neuroeconomics","fMRI","Social Learning","Decision Neuroscience","Prosociality"],"title":"Presentation in class on Park et al.(2020)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yoonseo Zoh"],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the slides used for my presentation .\n ","date":1557460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557460800,"objectID":"cc7b4a085ddb37b12b8d16fd5ef565a5","permalink":"https://zohyos7.github.io/talk/vanbaar/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/vanbaar/","section":"talk","summary":"I gave a presentation on the paper 'The computational and neural substrates of moral strategies in social decision-making' by van Baar et al.(2019) at the lab meeting.
